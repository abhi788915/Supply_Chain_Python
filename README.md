Power BI &amp; EDA Project: Product Performance &amp; Supply Chain Efficiency ðŸ“Š

Excited to share my recent project where I combined Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Power BI to create an interactive dashboard that provides deep insights into product performance and supply chain efficiency. This project showcases how data can drive better decision-making through effective visual storytelling.

Key Features:
Product Sales Analysis: Bar charts showing product sales by category, helping identify top-performing products.
Revenue Trends: Line charts tracking revenue over time with filters by product type for granular insights.
Price Distribution: Histograms revealing price distribution across various product types for pricing strategy optimization.
Stock Levels: Heat maps that visualize stock availability by SKU, ensuring optimal inventory management.
Lead Time vs. Order Quantities: Scatter plots to uncover correlations between lead times and order quantities across suppliers.
Shipping Costs & Carrier Efficiency: Bar charts analyzing shipping costs by carrier and location to optimize logistics.
Manufacturing Efficiency: Dual-axis charts that evaluate manufacturing lead times versus production volumes.
Customer Demographics Analysis: Demographic breakdown charts highlighting customer profiles and revenue contributions by segments.

By leveraging EDA techniques and Power BI, this dashboard provides actionable insights, helping businesses make data-driven decisions in product management, supply chain optimization, and customer segmentation.
